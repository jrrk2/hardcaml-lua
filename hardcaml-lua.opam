  "A lua client for interfacing hardcaml to verilator, UHDM, Verible and RTLIL front-ends"
description:
  "Verilator, Surelog and Verible do not generate synthesised Verilog code directly. This software bridges the gap and verifies the results using build-in minisat solver, z3 or external eqy script"
